### 2. Complex Application Deployment

- Load balancer implementation and configuration
- External service exposure
- Resource quota management
- Request/limit configurations for pods
- Graceful teardown procedures
- Cluster management best practices

### 3. Kubernetes Architecture Deep Dive

- Control plane components and functionality
- Worker node architecture
- Control plane and worker node interaction
- Cluster component analysis
  - etcd
  - kube-apiserver
  - kube-scheduler
  - kubelet
  - Container runtime

### 4. Advanced Topics

- `architecture` - Kubernetes architecture studies
- `advanced-topics` - Specialized Kubernetes features

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop or equivalent container runtime
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud-based)
- kubectl CLI tool
- Basic understanding of containerization

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
